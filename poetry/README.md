# Poetry

### Basics
1. Deterministic way to manage dependencies
2. Cooller than pip, lighter than docker
3. But adds some hassle to set up

### Usage
1. `poetry add [dependency]`
2. `poetry update`
3. `poetry env info`
4. `poetry build`
5. Commit `poetry.lock` and `pyproject.toml` to get deterministic builds

### Issues
1. The term 'poetry' is not recognized .... -> use separate (not VSC) PowerShell
