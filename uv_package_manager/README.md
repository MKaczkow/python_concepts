# UV package manager

* `uv add` -> add a package to the project, like `poetry add`
* `uv tree` -> cool way of visualizing dependencies tree
* env is not active *all the time*, but running is handled by `uv` itself, using `uv run` command
* `uv sync` -> syncs the environment with the `pyproject.toml` file
* *smart global caching system*
